**VSAI: A Multi-View Dataset for Vehicle Detection in Complex Scenarios Using Aerial Images** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the vehicle detection domain, and in the utilities industry. 

The dataset consists of 9075 images with 87802 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *small-vehicle* and *large-vehicle*.

Images in the VSAI dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 3703 (41% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (5240 images), *test* (2315 images), and *val* (1520 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the National University of Defense Technology, China.
